### Known Bugs and Issues
- After a `Triple Tap` or `Final Jump Tap`, the girl and the monkeys will not bop.
- `Scroll Background`'s scrolling animation appears jittery while starting up.
- `Scroll Background` does not stop when Scroll FX is unchecked.
- `Scroll Background`'s Flash FX toggle doesn't work.
- `Giraffe Animations`'s Enter? toggle does not do anything; instead, the giraffe will simply move in or out based on its current position.
	- This functionality is fine, but the toggle should be removed to prevent confusion.
- The giraffe is currently lacking miss animations.
