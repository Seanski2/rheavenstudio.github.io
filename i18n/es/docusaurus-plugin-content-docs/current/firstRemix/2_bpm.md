# Setting the BPM

1. Set the BPM. We'll be using Karate Man (GBA) in this tutorial, which is 119BPM. You can check [this page](/docs-tips/music/bpm) if you want more information on how to find the BPM of the song you're using.

If all previous steps were done correctly, we should have something like this.

<ReactPlayer controls url='/vid/firstchart/music.mp4' />
