# Arrays & Lists

## Arrays

* All arrays must be implicitly typed.
* The starting element in the array must have a space between it.
* The ending element in the array must have a space after it.
* All elements in an array must have a space between them.

```cs
string[] vowels = { "a", "e", "i", "o", "u" }
```

## Lists

Same rules as arrays.

```cs
List<string> vowels = new() { "a", "e", "i", "o", "u" };
```
