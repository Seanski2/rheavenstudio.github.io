# Charting the remix
Let's start charting the remix.

1. Select a minigame by clicking on an icon in the minigame selection menu.

2. From the events window right next to it, drag and drop the "Switch Game" event to the timeline.
Note: Make sure you are on the Selection tool, otherwise drag-and-drop will be disabled. Enable it by pressing `1` on your keyboard, or by clicking the mouse icon underneath the game selection.

3. Next, press the up/down arrow keys on your keyboard to select other events. You can also use your scroll wheel while hovering over the cue selection window. Since we're using Coin Toss for now, we'll go with "Toss Coin".

4. We'll now switch to another minigame. Click a minigame's icon, then drag and drop the "Switch Game" event to the timeline.
Note: You can right click at the beats bar to select when to start playback.

5. Put the event you want to use in the minigame you just switched to, since we're using Karate Man, we'll go with "Toss Object".

This is how it looks and sounds now.
