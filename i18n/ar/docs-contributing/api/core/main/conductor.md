# Conductor

The `Conductor` is responsible for all beat and time management in Heaven Studio. 

The `Conductor` is mostly used in games to calculate the positions of animations, and when sounds should be played.

You can play a single `AudioClip` using `Play`, `Pause` and `Stop`. You can adjust its volume with `SetVolume`, or seek using the multiple *songPositions*.

## Example

```cs
using UnityEngine;

using HeavenStudio;

namespace HeavenStudio.Games
{
    public class ExampleGame : Minigame
    {
        public Animation referenceAnimation;

        public void Update()
        {
            // If the songPositionInBeats is 1, this will return 0.5f;
            float normalizedAnimTime = Conductor.instance.GetPositionFromBeat(0, 2f);

            referenceAnimation.Play("Bounce", 0, normalizedAnimTime);
        }
    }
}

```
