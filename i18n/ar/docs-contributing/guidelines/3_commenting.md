# Commenting

* Place the comment on a separate line, not at the end of a line of code, or God forbid the start of a line of code.
* Insert one space between the comment delimiter (//) and the comment text.
* Must include proper grammar.
* Must be in English.

```cs
✅

// This is an ok comment.
// this is an ok comment

/*
This is an ok comment.
As long as it has multiple lines.
*/

// This is also acceptable for multi-line comments.
// Why wouldn't it be?

⚠️

//This is not an ok comment.
public float a; // This is not an ok comment.
/* This is not an ok comment. */ public float a;
// Ce n'est pas un commentaire correct.
// thes not okey coment
```
