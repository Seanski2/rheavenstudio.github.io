# Purpose of these Docs

* Consistency and clarity: Coding guidelines ensure that everyone in the community is using a consistent style and structure for writing code. This makes it easier for everyone to understand each other's code, leading to increased collaboration and reduced confusion.

* Improved code quality: By establishing a clear set of standards for how code should be written, coding guidelines can help ensure that the code in the project is of high quality, reducing the likelihood of bugs and making it easier to maintain.

* Increased collaboration and participation: When everyone in a community follows the same coding guidelines, it becomes easier for new contributors to get involved and start contributing to the project. This can increase the number of contributors and the overall size of the community, leading to a more vibrant and active open-source project. Additionally, clear guidelines can help to reduce conflicts and disagreements within the community, improving collaboration and the overall health of the project.
